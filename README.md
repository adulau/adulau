# Bio

My name is Alexandre Dulaunoy (adulau). I break stuff and I do stuff. The majority of my work is [open source](https://opensource.org/osd) (or [free software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Free_Software_Definition)) in various fields such as information security. I'm part of the following organisation on GitHub where I'm regularly contributing such as [@MISP](https://github.com/MISP) [@AIL-project](https://github.com/ail-project) [@d4-project](https://github.com/d4-project) [@circl](https://github.com/circl) [@cve-search](https://github.com/cve-search) [@hashlookup](https://github.com/hashlookup) and some others where I'm contributing a bit less.

|[ssldump](https://github.com/adulau/ssldump)|ssldump is an SSLv3/TLS network protocol analyzer. It identifies TCP connections on the chosen network interface and attempts to interpret them as SSLv3/TLS traffic.
